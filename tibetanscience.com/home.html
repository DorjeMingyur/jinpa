<h1>Ancient knowledge for modern society.</h1>

<p>
Since time immemorial the human intuition have the longing desire to know and explore the event unfolding in their life and the society at large. But this actually can be known and predicted either by the enlightened being(God), after reaching certain level of realization of the ultimate truth Or by the professional astrologer, based on text and experience that these extraordinary being have shared and written.

<p>
Tibetan Astro Science is one unique art of prediction that flourish in the mystic region of Himalayas for more than three thousand years. It was further enriched and standardized by including some fascinating knowledge from Indian and China. Thus, this treasure of knowledge has been very helpful to reveal some striking secret of personal life as well as general phenomena of the celestial body and its effect down on earth. But here we should never play down the effect of karmic influence on our fate. Our fate is of course mainly decided by our deeds. But, we all know that the out-come of our best deeds is not always the satisfactory one. Therefore, time factor and other invisible influence cannot be rule out. Thus, it would be most appropriate to believe that out fate has co-operating influence from our deeds and other invisible effects. 

<p>
The most remarkable thing about Tibetan Astrology is that it not only predicted your life, to raise concern but tells you the remedies if some unforeseen obstacles is indicate in your chart.  Thus, it is like guidance for a person through out the life since it covers all the major event of your life like health, education, financial prospect, marriage, family, job etc. Mechanisms of this art of prediction can be summed up in three main principles; Elemental balance, planetary influence and the time factor.

<p>
When the whole world is busy developing the material infrastructure, intellectual in Tibet looked within and advance themselves in spiritual field for many centuries until red Chinese illegally occupied it.  Idea of relating outside phenomena to inner chakra of our body simply mesmerizes me.  I am blessed to get the precious opportunity to master in this field of knowledge and I pledge to work for the preservation of this unique science, at all my capacity. 

<p>It is with great satisfaction and joy to be able to launch this site at the service for those who long for guide and the platform for those who want to explore this ancient knowledge.
