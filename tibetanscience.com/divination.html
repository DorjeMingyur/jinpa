<h1>Divination</h1>
<p>
Divination is one art of prediction where we seeks divine's intervention to know the insight understanding when we are in the state of serious confusion or indecisiveness.
</p>
<p>
Here, it is very important to have sheer sense of believe and trust for the God and the messenger {astrologer} when seeking the divination. On the other hand, the person who performs divination needs to go through certain prayers to connect himself with the God before starting the divination. 
</p>
<p>
The divination is best advisable only when the person is completely in the state of dilemma and willing to go either way, which is more appropriate to oneself. In such situation, taking refugee to the god and to sort his guidance is indeed a very good and sensible idea. 
</p>
<p>

Tibetan Buddhist astrology has its own unique way of doing divination, which I learned and practiced for last many years. People's response to this is very encouraging which gives me sense of satisfaction! Here we can't apply the rules of logic, as it is something beyond the reach of common people. Nevertheless, the bottom line is it works when there is faith.
</p>
<p>
I am happy to extend my sincere help for those who are in needs of such divination to sort out the confusion in making right decision. But it is advice that final decision is completely entitle to the concern person. 
</p>
<p>
This service is done at completely free of cost for all but firm faith is very necessary here.
